## What is an API (Application Programming Interface)?
- Application refers to an end software product
- APIs can reference other APIs
- Used for accessing other data, conveniences, help define a structure, etc.
- APIs are not the end product

(i.e., what programmers create for other programmers)

Examples:
- Twitter API (client-server) - developer can request any tweet from any user
- GitHub API (client-server) -developer can look up public contributions and, if logged in, create new repos

Note: any set of functions created and bundled is an API. You have created APIs in previous classes.

## Student Requested APIs
We will go over the APIs that students were interested in exploring

## Individual Brainstorming
Students will brainstorm projects for group project individually 

## Group Brainstorming
Students will brainstorm projects for group project as a group. The class will assemble a list of possible projects to work on for the rest of the semester.
